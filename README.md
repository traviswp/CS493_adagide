# SIDE++

The Simple Integrated Development Environemnt for C++ (SIDE++) was a project that was picked up by 
Travis Peters, Michael McAallister, and Christopher Proteau in CSCI 493: Software Implementation 
in the Fall of 2012 at Western Washington University (WWU).

The original project belongs to the department of Computer Science at WWU, but this forked repository will consist
of my personal development to tighten up the project.

The project is not entirely complete but is currently a functional and useful tool for introductory students
that are trying to learn the C++ programming language. The intention of the project was to create a 
development environment for introductory programming students so that they could focus on learning the intricicies
of the language, rather than getting hung-up in more complex development enviornments like Visual Studio, but still
providing helpful tools such as project management guidance, basic text editor features, syntax hilighting, etc...
